MemeMe v1 app was made as part of "UIKit Fundamentals" course on Udacity.

In the v1 of the app, the user can only make a meme after clicking an image or slecting an image from the gallery. But the meme will not be saved.

The app has just one view and has the following implemented:
1. Notification System
2. Editable Textviews
3. Shifting the view up to accomodate the keyboard (for case where the keyboard blocks the textview)

V2 of the meme me app is available here: https://github.com/isha04/memeMe_V2
